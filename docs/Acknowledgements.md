I know I'm largely creating stuff that has been done before (in many ways even more comprehensive or better than I have done here). These projects are the inspiration, and sometimes even the source code for much of this work.

**Lazywinadmin's - [AdsiPS](https://github.com/lazywinadmin/AdsiPS)**
I found this one later in my coding of this module. I plan on grabbing some stuff from this project more in the future so I may as well just list this here now.

**DarkOperator's - [ADAudit](https://github.com/darkoperator/ADAudit/tree/dev)**
This is a module in development with some great blog articles that follow the coding path taken for development. I REALLY liked the cmdlet naming convention
and some of the other tricks used in this project but found some other decisions confusing. I've taken liberally from this project.

**PowerView (in PowerSploit) - [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon)**
I started this module by tearing this module apart. I still want to use many of the functions in this module but most of them need complete rewriting.

This project owes some acknowlegement to other projects as well. Here are some other authors or projects which have made this project possible. If you believe you or a project should be included in this list please let us know.

[ModuleBuild](https://github.com/zloeber/ModuleBuild) - A PowerShell module build framwork.
